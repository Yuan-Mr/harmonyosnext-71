**Hey, all HarmonyOS developers!**  

Have you ever felt that while official documentation is comprehensive, it's like a massive treasure trove‚Äîfull of super practical "gold mines" that are easy to miss without careful exploration? Recently, I accidentally unearthed a treasure chapter on **memory optimization**, whose tools and techniques are incredibly useful! Many cases and methods can truly be lifesavers in real development, preventing app lag, crashes, and extending device battery life.  

Today, I'll share this treasure with you, organizing it into a highly practical memory optimization guide based on official content and my understanding. Let's skip the fluff and dive intoÂπ≤Ë¥ß, cases, and code! üí™  


## üß† Why Is Memory Optimization So Important? (Official Insights + Plain Language)  

The official docs put it well: Memory is a scarce system resource. When an app consumes excessive memory, the system struggles with frequent garbage collection and allocation, leading to **lag, slowdowns, or even crashes**! Imagine the phone's background frantically "cleaning up"‚Äîhow can your app not lag?  

- **Benefits of memory optimization**: Smoother app performance, faster response times, lower system resource consumption, and extended battery life (users will love it!).  
- **In a nutshell**: Good memory management = better app experience, satisfied users, happy bosses, and less stress for you!  


## üîç Treasure 1: Insight into Memory Usage - Official Toolchain (`HiDumper`)  

The official documentation mentions a powerful command-line tool, `HiDumper`, which directly views detailed memory information of apps on devices. This is far more intuitive than abstract data in an IDE!  

### üìå Practical Steps & Explanation  

1. **Find your app's process ID (PID):**  
   ```bash  
   hdc shell "hidumper -s WindowManagerService -a '-a'"  
   ```  
   - This command lists all window-related info. Locate your app's package name (e.g., `com.example.myawesomeapp`) to find the corresponding **PID**‚Äîyour app's unique identifier in the system.  

2. **View detailed memory report:**  
   ```bash  
   hdc shell "hidumper --mem [yourAppPID]"  
   ```  
   - Replace `[yourAppPID]` with the actual PID from the previous step. After execution, you'll get a detailed memory report.  

3. **Key metric interpretation - Focus!**  
   The report contains much data. Official guidance emphasizes monitoring the **`Total` column of `PSS (Proportional Set Size)`**.  

   - **What is PSS?** It represents the **actual physical memory used by your app**. This is the **gold standard** for measuring memory usage, more accurate than virtual memory (`VSS`) or resident memory (`RSS`) because it accounts for shared library allocation.  

   - **Key parts of a sample report (simplified):**  
     ```  
     ... (other info) ...  
     PSS:               26279 kB (TOTAL)  
     ... (memory category details) ...  
       ark ts heap:        4712 kB  
       native heap:       13164 kB  
       ... (other stacks, shared libraries, etc.) ...  
     ```  
   - **Interpretation:** This app uses ~26.3MB of physical memory, including:  
     - `ark ts heap (4712KB ‚âà 4.6MB)`: Heap memory occupied by your ArkTS code (mainly JS/TS objects)‚Äîthe **main battlefield for optimization**!  
     - `native heap (13164KB ‚âà 12.8MB)`: Memory allocated by the native layer (C/C++ code, third-party native libraries, part of the system framework). If this is abnormally high, check for memory leaks or large object allocations in native code or used libraries.  


### üí° Developer Perspective  

- **When to use?** When your app feels laggy or you suspect high memory usage, use this command first to understand the overall situation and component ratios, quickly identifying whether the issue is in the JS or native layer.  
- **Comparative analysis:** Run the command multiple times in different scenarios (just after startup, after functional operations, after running in the background for a while) to compare PSS changes and identify memory growth points.  
- **What if Native Heap is high?** Combine with memory snapshot analysis (`DevEco Profiler`) or native memory analysis tools (e.g., `asan`, supported by HarmonyOS) for in-depth troubleshooting.  


## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Treasure 2: Hunting Memory Leaks - Magic Tool `DevEco Profiler`  

The official docs mention two core memory analysis functions of DevEco Studio's built-in profiler (`Profiler`):  

1. **Allocation Tracking:**  
   - **What's it for?** Monitors in real-time **when and where (which thread, which call stack) your app allocates memory objects of various types**.  
   - **Practical uses:**  
     - Identify areas with massive small object allocations in a short time (which may cause frequent GC lag).  
     - Locate the source of large object allocations.  
     - Observe whether memory allocation hotspots are reasonable in conjunction with operational scenarios.  

2. **Heap Snapshot:**  
   - **What's it for?** Takes a "photo" of your app's memory heap at a specific moment (e.g., when a leak is suspected), recording **all live objects** and their reference relationships.  
   - **Golden method for hunting leaks:**  
     1. Before operating in a scenario prone to leaks (e.g., opening a page), manually trigger **GC (garbage collection)**.  
     2. Take a snapshot `Snapshot 1`.  
     3. Perform the potentially leaky operation (e.g., repeatedly operating on or navigating in and out of the page).  
     4. After the operation, trigger GC again.  
     5. Take a second snapshot `Snapshot 2`.  
     6. The profiler provides a comparison function (`Compare to previous snapshot` or `Compare to baseline snapshot`).  
     7. **Focus on:** Objects that appear in the comparison (`Delta` / `+` sign)! Especially those that should have been recycled after the operation (via GC). If the count or total size of a class/object grows abnormally and you can't find a reasonable holder (e.g., wrong references by global variables or long-lifecycle objects), it's likely a leak point!  


### üí° Developer Perspective + Tips  

- **Allocation practice:** Suspect a list is lagging when scrolling? Enable Allocation Tracking, scroll the list, and check if small objects (e.g., temporary strings, small arrays) are being frantically created in `build()` or during data updates. Optimization may involve reusing objects or avoiding complex calculations/temporary large object creation in `build()`.  

- **Snapshot comparison practice (suspected page leak):**  
  ```typescript  
  // Suppose we have a potentially leaky page PageA  
  import { BusinessError } from '@ohos.base';  

  @Entry  
  @Component  
  struct PageA {  
    private expensiveData: any[] = []; // Holds large data  

    // Simulate data loading (may not release correctly)  
    loadData() {  
      // ... Fetch data and assign to expensiveData ...  
    }  

    onPageShow() {  
      this.loadData();  
    }  

    // ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Missing onPageHide or aboutToDisappear to release expensiveData!  
    // When the page is navigated out of the stack, expensiveData may not be released due to references from other objects  
  }  
  ```  
  - **Operation:** Repeatedly open `PageA` and return.  
  - **Snapshot comparison:** You'll find that after each open and return, the count/size of `expensiveData` arrays or their internal object types in the snapshot continues to increase, even after manual GC. This strongly indicates that `PageA` instances or `expensiveData` aren't released correctly.  
  - **Fix:** Clear `expensiveData` in the `aboutToDisappear` lifecycle:  
    ```typescript  
    aboutToDisappear() {  
      this.expensiveData = []; // Release references to allow GC to collect actual data  
    }  
    ```  

- **Tips:** Give custom classes a clear, identifiable `constructor.name` for easier recognition in snapshots. `Retained Size` in snapshots is more important than `Shallow Size`‚Äîit represents the total memory occupied by the object and all its dependent objects.  


## üö® Treasure 3: Memory Shortage Warning & Self-Rescue - `onMemoryLevel` Listening  

This function is critical! When memory is tight, the HarmonyOS system notifies your app via the `onMemoryLevel` callback‚Äî**your app's last chance to "self-rescue"!** The official provides three registration methods:  

1. **`AbilityStage`:** Suitable for memory response at the HAP level, handled in the `onMemoryLevel` method of `AbilityStage`.  
2. **`UIAbility` (or base class `Ability`):** Suitable for memory response at the Ability level, handled in the corresponding Ability's `onMemoryLevel` method.  
3. **`EnvironmentCallback`:** Registered via `ApplicationContext`, suitable for global memory listening associated with the application context.  


### üìä Memory Levels (MemoryLevel)  

The official defines three levels, understood more intuitively as:  

| Level Constant                | Value | System State                          | What Should Your App Do?                                                                 |  
|-----------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **`MEMORY_LEVEL_MODERATE`**  | 0     | Memory is **starting to get tight**. The system kills background processes by LRU. | **Beware!** Consider releasing **non-core**, reconstructable resources (e.g., large image caches for non-current views, partial historical data). Evaluate the risk of being killed. |  
| **`MEMORY_LEVEL_LOW`**       | 1     | Memory is **very low**. The system is under high pressure, with high lag risk.       | **Act immediately!** Release **as many** non-essential resources as possible (clear most caches, pause non-critical background tasks, release temporary large objects). |  
| **`MEMORY_LEVEL_CRITICAL`**  | 2     | Memory is **extremely tight**. The system is on the verge of collapse, and even core processes may be killed. | **Desperate self-rescue!** Release **all** releasable resources (clear all caches, stop all background tasks, save the absolute minimum state). Prepare to be killed at any time. |  


### üíª Code Example: Listening and Responding in UIAbility  

```typescript  
import UIAbility from '@ohos.app.ability.UIAbility';  
import window from '@ohos.window';  
import { logger } from './Logger'; // Assume a logging tool  
import { myCacheManager } from './MyCacheManager'; // Assume a cache management module  

export default class EntryAbility extends UIAbility {  

  // ... Other lifecycle methods ...  

  onMemoryLevel(level: AbilityConstant.MemoryLevel) {  
    logger.info(`[MemoryLevel] Received memory level: ${level}`);  
    switch (level) {  
      case AbilityConstant.MemoryLevel.MEMORY_LEVEL_MODERATE:  
        logger.warn('[MemoryLevel] MODERATE: Memory pressure is building. Releasing non-critical caches.');  
        // Release first-level non-core caches (e.g., long-unused images, data from non-current modules)  
        myCacheManager.releaseLevelOneCache();  
        break;  
      case AbilityConstant.MemoryLevel.MEMORY_LEVEL_LOW:  
        logger.error('[MemoryLevel] LOW: Memory is very low! Releasing most caches and pausing heavy tasks.');  
        // Release most caches, pause non-critical background tasks, network prefetching, etc.  
        myCacheManager.releaseMostCaches();  
        myBackgroundTaskManager.pauseNonCriticalTasks(); // Assumed background task manager  
        break;  
      case AbilityConstant.MemoryLevel.MEMORY_LEVEL_CRITICAL:  
        logger.fatal('[MemoryLevel] CRITICAL: Memory critical! Releasing EVERYTHING non-essential and saving state!');  
        // Clear all caches, stop all background tasks, save the most critical app state (e.g., draft forms being edited by the user)  
        myCacheManager.clearAllCaches();  
        myBackgroundTaskManager.stopAllTasks();  
        this.saveCriticalState(); // Custom method to save critical state  
        break;  
      default:  
        logger.warn(`[MemoryLevel] Unknown level received: ${level}`);  
    }  
  }  

  private saveCriticalState() {  
    // Save absolutely critical state here, such as unsubmitted form content being entered by the user.  
    // Note: Act fast! Memory is almost exhausted!  
    // E.g., persist to Preferences or Database.  
  }  
}  
```  


### üí° Developer Perspective & Important Tips  

- **Choose the appropriate registration point:** If the response is global (e.g., clearing caches), place it in `AbilityStage` or `EnvironmentCallback`. If the response is strongly related to a specific Ability's state (e.g., saving the current page draft), place it in that `UIAbility`.  
- **Act fast!** Especially at `LOW` and `CRITICAL` levels, the system is in a critical state, and your response code must be **efficient** and **quick**. Avoid time-consuming operations (complex calculations, large file IO) in the callback.  
- **What to release?** Plan your resource hierarchy in advance:  
  - Level 1 cache (least important, reconstructable at any time)  
  - Level 2 cache (somewhat more important)  
  - Critical state (user data, current progress)  
  - Memory required for core operations.  
- **No callback when background frozen:** **Remember!** The official clearly states: **If an app is already frozen in the background, it won't receive the `onMemoryLevel` callback!** The system directly manages the memory of frozen apps based on policies. Thus, this mechanism mainly targets foreground or active background apps.
